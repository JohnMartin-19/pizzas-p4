The project consist of both a client(FrontEnd) built in React, and a server(Backend) built in Django&DRF.
I started by creating the Backend, exposing the endpoints and tested the APIs making sure that they are consumable by the frontend. It works. To access the server, activate the .venv then run the server(port=8000)-Default.
I have documented my APIs using Swagger-UI. This makes it easier for any developer to consumer my APIs at this interface.
# Getting Started with Create React App
I created my react app in the client directory to separate the functionalities of client & server.
The frontend app runs on port 3000 and it has been configured in the backend by the CORS. Hence, not any other unspecified port can access the backend.
